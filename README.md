# Tests to measure object recognition ability using jsPsych
The implemented tests do not save any data right now. You must add the code to save data dependent on the platform they are being used on (cognition.run, pavlovia, etc).
The stimuli are stored in a zip file in the [Releases](https://github.com/OPLabVanderbilt/Ojs/releases). For each task to run, you must copy the associated stimuli folder to the folder of the task you are running and rename that stimuli folder "stimuli".
For example, "stimuli_newObject" would be copied to the "NewObject" folder containing "experiment.html" and "trials.js", and "stimuli_newObject" would then be renamed to "stimuli".
