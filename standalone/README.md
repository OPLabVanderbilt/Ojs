# Standalone Tests for Object Recognition Ability (o)
Here, we have standalone versions of the tests used in Smithson et al. (in prep). These tests
have been packaged as standalone folders for each test so that they can be used
easily offline. All tests will run with attention checks in the middle of the
test by default.

To download the tests, download the zip file from this [release](https://github.com/OPLabVanderbilt/Ojs/releases/download/v2.2/oJS-standalone-v2.2.zip). 
Then unzip the file and each test will be in a separate folder ready to use. 

To run a test, just open the experiment.html file. It should open in your 
browser and run the test. Each test will allow you to input parameters to save
to the datafile, each option is optional. If the subject ID is not inputted, a
random one will be generated. When the test is finished, the data will be saved 
as a download.

Each test has limited options that can be edited by editing the experiment.html
file with a text editor.

Other forms of object recognition ability tests is available in the root of 
this repository.
